### This is a invoicing app that can:

- Create a new invoice
- Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
- Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
- Send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails, but if it does, great!)
- View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)
