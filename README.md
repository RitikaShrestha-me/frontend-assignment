# TaxAdda Frontend Assignment

### This is a invoicing app that can:

- Create a new invoice
- Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
- Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
- Send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails, but if it does, great!)
- View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)

# Final Product

### My Approach


- This invoice app acts as both a Dashboard and Invoice Generator. Also it has a hotlist card for overdue invoices.
- Invoice in table are displayed in FIFO manner and can be sorted by click.
- On click of each row, you can view the invoice and either save the pdf or send email.
- To create new invoice, just click on 'New Invoice' button and follow the flow.
